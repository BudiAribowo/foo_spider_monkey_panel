# Current
- Check drag-n-drop functionality.
- Check that all files are correctly parsed: UTF8, UTF8-BOM, ASCII.
- Rewrite ActiveXObject properly (and rename the files as well).
- Update docs.
- Complete rebranding to spider_monkey_panel.
- Check that it can work side-by-side with foo-jscript-panel.
- Remove engine settings from Panel Properties dialog.
- Move all failable initialization from ctor to Create (add PostCreate?).
- Document that toArray() methods are not needed anymore.
- Check all TODOs.
- Stop staying up all night making this...

# Planned
- Try to make it work with paths containing cyrillics and other exotic characters
- Move setInterval and co to global namespace.
- Port hacks from ui_hacks.
- Add ES6 modules support (`import`).
- Replace PropertyList with something more maintenable.
- Save Panel Properties dialog size between calls.
- Add array conversion support in ActiveXObject.
- See if it's possible to export some common Array checking/creating/parsing code.

# Maybe
- Raise warning level to W4 or WALL with WERROR
- Add help to properties and methods (JS_DefineFunctionsWithHelp)
- Replace separate JSON parser with the one from JS engine.
- Minimal .js tests for all the functionality.
