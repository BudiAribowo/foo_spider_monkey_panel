# Current
- Just great: 'Shell.Application' (???), 'WScript.Shell' (Run, RegRead, maybe RegWrite), 'Scripting.FileSystemObject' (w3c) are inaccessible outside wscript...
- Change scintilla classname: https://github.com/TheQwertiest/foo-jscript-panel/commit/57393822ae42e1ebd77911c0f934471903975b4e#commitcomment-29624489

- Reimplement ActiveXObject accessors through proxy instead of current hacks.
- Test `include` with various codepages (esp. JP,KR,CH)
- Diagnose JS_ShutDown freeze on conditional wait on fb2k exit
- Check utf8 literals everywhere (paths, script window, script files, properties, callback arguments)
- Check drag-n-drop functionality.
- Check that all files are correctly parsed: UTF8, UTF8-BOM, ASCII.
- Rewrite ActiveXObject properly (and rename the files as well).
- Complete rebranding to spider_monkey_panel.
- Check that it can work side-by-side with foo-jscript-panel.
- Remove engine settings from Panel Properties dialog.
- Move all failable initialization from ctor to Create (add PostCreate?).
- Document that toArray() methods are not needed anymore.
- Document FbHandleList.Item removal ([] proxy)
- Document that everything is case-sensitive (unlike how it was in WSH\IE...)
- Update docs.
- Check all TODOs.
- Why is this list getting longer, instead of shorter?!
- Stop staying up all night making this...

# Planned
- Try to make it work with paths containing cyrillics and other exotic characters
- Move setInterval and co to global namespace.
- Port hacks from ui_hacks.
- Add ES6 modules support (`import`).
- Replace PropertyList with something more maintenable.
- Save Panel Properties dialog size between calls.
- Add array conversion support in ActiveXObject.
- See if it's possible to export some common Array checking/creating/parsing code.

# Maybe
- Replace in-repository scintilla with it's submodule.
- Update scintilla to the latest version.
- Update scintilla JS keywords list
- Replace in-repository wtl with it's submodule.
- Raise warning level to W4 or WALL with WERROR
- Add help to properties and methods (JS_DefineFunctionsWithHelp)
- Investigate: separate native JSON parser vs one from SpiderMonkey engine.
- Minimal .js tests for all the functionality.
