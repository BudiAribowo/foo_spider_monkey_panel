# Current
- Check that all callbacks are defined.
- Add default arguments everywhere.
- Check drag-n-drop functionality.
- Check that all files are correctly parsed: UTF8, UTF8-BOM, ASCII.
- Rewrite ActiveXObject properly (and rename the files as well).
- Implement timers.
- Update docs.
- Complete rebranding to spider_monkey_panel.
- Check that it can work side-by-side with foo-jscript-panel.
- Remove engine settings from Panel Properties dialog.

# Planned
- Port hacks from ui_hacks.
- Add `include(path.to.js)` method for loading scripts.
- Add ES6 modules support (`import`).
- Fill callbacks argument count everywhere.
- Replace PropertyList with something more maintenable.
- Save Panel Properties dialog size between calls.
- Add array conversion support in ActiveXObject.
- See if it's possible to export some common Array checking/creating/parsing code.

# Maybe
- Add help to properties and methods
- Replace separate JSON parser with the one from JS engine.
- Minimal .js tests for all the functionality.
