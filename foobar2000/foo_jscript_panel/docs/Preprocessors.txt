DESCRIPTION
All preprocessors are started with "==PREPROCESSOR==" and ended with "==/PREPROCESSOR==":
VBScript:
' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
' ...
' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

JScript:
// ==PREPROCESSOR==
// ...
// ==/PREPROCESSOR==

And be aware that all preprocessors (directives) are case sensitive.

DIRECTIVES
Directives should be started with "@", and placed into a single comment.
VBScript:
' // @directive "value-here"

JScript:
// @directive "value-here"

IMPORT
@import "path"
Load external script from "path".
You can place %fb2k_path%, %fb2k_component_path% and %fb2k_profile_path% into "path", they will be expanded while parsing.

FEATURE
@feature "dragdrop"
Enable drag drop callbacks.

Between versions "v1.5.7" and "v1.5.12", the following must be set for on_metadb_changed()
to work (see notes in callbacks.txt)
@feature "v1.4"
@feature "watch-metadb"

As of v1.6.0, they are default and may be omitted. If you share scripts, you should leave
them present for compatibilty with previous components.

NAME
@name "name"

VERSION
@version "version"

AUTHOR
@author "author"

With "name", "version" and "author", if you want to use double quotes then you must escape each one with another...
@name "One aka ""1"""

A JScript example:
// ==PREPROCESSOR==
// @name "my sooper dooper script"
// @author "marc"
// @version "0.1"
// @feature "v1.4"
// @feature "watch-metadb"
// @feature "dragdrop"
// ==/PREPROCESSOR==
