# foo_jscript_panel
foobar2000 component

This is a customisable panel for the [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) audio player. It is based on [WSH Panel Mod](https://code.google.com/archive/p/foo-wsh-panel-mod/).

All scripts are written in Javascript but the component provides means to do the following:

* Custom drawing of text, images, lines, rectangles, etc.
* Executing main/context menu commands.
* Ability to create custom buttons/menus.
* Callbacks can be used to trigger code based on foobar2000 events . See [callbacks.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/19379/foo-jscript-panel/master/foo_jscript_panel/docs/Callbacks.txt).
* Read/write file tags.
* Complete manipulation of playlists.
* Media Library display/sorting/filtering
* And much more...
