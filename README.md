* Custom drawing of text, images, lines, rectangles, etc.
* Executing main/context menu commands.
* Ability to create custom buttons/menus.
* Callbacks can be used to trigger code based on foobar2000 events . See [callbacks.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/19379/foo-jscript-panel/master/foo_jscript_panel/docs/Callbacks.txt).
* Read/write file tags.
* Complete manipulation of playlists.
* Media Library display/sorting/filtering
