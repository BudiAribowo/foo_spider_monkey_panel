# foo_jscript_panel

This is a customisable panel for the [foobar2000)[https://www.foobar2000.org/] audio player. It is based on [WSH Panel Mod](https://code.google.com/p/foo-wsh-panel-mod/).

All scripts are written in Javascript but the component provides means to do the following:

* Custom drawing of text, images, lines, rectangles, etc.
* Executing main/context menu commands.
* Ability to create custom buttons/menus.
* Callbacks can be used to trigger code based on foobar2000 events such as playback starting, switching playlists, removing playlist items, etc.
* Read/write file tags.
* Complete manipulation of playlists.
* And much more...
